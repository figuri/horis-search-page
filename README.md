### **-What is this project?**

This project is a refactoring of a Search website called Horiseon. 
On it you will find that the information displayed assertains to search engines and how they are used in todays world. I Restructured this webpage to have more organized code and be more accessible for blind users.

### **-Why on earth did I do this !?**

The websites funcionality apeared at first to be perfect; but upon further inspection I could tell that one of the links did not go where it should. Following this discovery after examining the html and css files corresponding with the webpages repository that the code was disorganized and was vague full of generic div tags and redundant styling code.

### **-How did I do this?**

I created my own directory with github and cloned it down to gitbash on my local device, I copied the source code over to my git repository and opened it with vscode. Using Vscode I was able to edit the contained html, and css ffiles to have semantic elements that describe the elements and style points accurately and in an organized fashion.

## *Below are some examples of the refactoring that I did.*

[This is a screenshot of a snippet of html code where I changed several generic 'div' tags to semantic elements]![Alt text](<Screenshot (6).png>)

[This screenshot shows another instance where semantic html elements were more descriptive than generic div tags]![Alt text](<Screenshot (7).png>)

[This screenshot shows where I changed css selectors to correctly style the corresponding html elements that were changed in the previous screenshots]![Alt text](<Screenshot (8).png>)

[Lastly I removed redundant css stylepoints that made the code longer than necessary
below is a screenshot showing css selectors that had the same styling grouped here together]![Alt text](<Screenshot (5).png>)


## Learning points:

I learned alot about html and css, how to use many different styling with fonts and placement. I learned alot about semantic html elements and where to use them. Before doing this project I could barely understand a single line of code, now I feel confident I can build my own website from scratch; granted it would be very simple !
